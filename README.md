# FDF
![](/images/42_blue.png)
The goal of the project is to study the basics of graphic programming, and in particular how
to place points in space, how to join them with segments and most importantly how to
observe the scene from a particular viewpoint.

The graphics library minilibmlx was used. This library handles user events and updates the screen.
